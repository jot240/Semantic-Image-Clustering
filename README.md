Using transformer to group captioned images

This notebook embeds image captions generated from a CNN-LSTM image caption generator using a transformer neural network. We then use these embedding for image grouping and querying. (Like this one https://github.com/yunjey/pytorch-tutorial/tree/master/tutorials/03-advanced/image_captioning)
